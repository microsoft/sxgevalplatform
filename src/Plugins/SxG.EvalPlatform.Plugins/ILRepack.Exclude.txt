# ILRepack Internalize Exclusions
# Types matching these patterns will remain public in the merged assembly
# All other types (including Application Insights) will be internalized

# Keep plugin namespace types public so they can be loaded by the plugin host
^SxG\.EvalPlatform\.Plugins\.

# Note: All Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.* types will be internalized
# This prevents conflicts with other versions of Application Insights
